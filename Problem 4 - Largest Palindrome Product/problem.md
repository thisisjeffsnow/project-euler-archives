# Problem

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Solution

By quick inspection, $10101 = 101 \cdot 101$ and $111111 = 777 \cdot 143$ while $999^2 < 1000000 = 1000^2$ and $999999 = 999\cdot1001$, so the solution must be a 6-digit integer.

Let $S = ABCCBA = 100000A + 10000B + 1000C + 100C + 10B + A$

$S = 11\cdot\left(9091A + 910B + 100C\right)$

Now what?
