# Problem 6 - Sum Square Difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385$$

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$\left(1 + 2 + ... + 10\right)^2 = 55^2 = 3025$$

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 - 385 = 2640$.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

# Solution

Pen and paper and sigma formulas.

$$S = \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{100}i\right)^2 - \sum_{i = 1}^{100}i^2$$

$$S = \left(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{100\cdot(100 + 1)\cdot(2\cdot100 + 1)}{6}$$

$$S = 25502500 - 338350$$

$$S = 25164150$$
